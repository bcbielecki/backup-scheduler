# Git Repo CI/CD
This repo utilizes GitHub Actions to package, lint, and test (based on unittests) commits on a variety of Python versions and operating systems.
The pipeline is based on this [GitHub Action Python documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/build-and-test-code/python#using-a-python-workflow-template).

The actions are stored in .yaml files under the repo directory ./.github/workflows/
